# Project Proposal

# Proposal #1 
###### **By Niel Chonoolal** 

## Project Title - Busy? 

## What and why? 

The software system will be a task managment system that is shared between a community of friends, to allow them to see when you are free or to see if they are free. An example of a problem can be seen in college, friend groups often have different classes and times of avaliabilty which can often lead to constant rescheudling and can be overwhelming to really find the perfect time to see each other and catch up. 


## For Whom?

Targeted mainly to college students and people who have friends. Personally my friends and I are constantly busy with new things and it can be hard to find time to really see each other. 

## How? 
Interface: 
1. Private Calendar - Calendar format that highlights specific hours of your schedule using colors. The options of how to view the calendar are Year, Month, Week, Day. 
2. Group Calendar - The Calendar that highlights times of friends within group that are not busy, can used to schedule group hang outs
3. Friend Calendar - If user wants to hang out with a specific friend, clicking on a friends schedule can show their current schedule, and see times when they are busy. IMPORTANT: user cannot see what the friend is busy with just the times they are busy on a calendar not the decription of what they are busy with.  

Process of the system is as follows:
1. User Input events, tasks and times they are busy into a calendar by selecting date and time frame of the input 
2. All inputs will private in description to only the user. 
3. User can input an avaliabilty feature, this will be added to the group calendar. If user has multiple groups they can toggle which group to add the avaliabilty to. Notification will be sent to memebers to group to see that User is avaliable. 
4. Users can create groups of friends where all of their times of avaliabilty can be shown on a group calendar however the only thing they can view is the times of avaliabilty.
5. Within group calendar members can schedule events, and other members can RSVP through group calendar if they can make it. 

## Scope 

The project is not too easy due to all of the features that needed to be implemented. However it is not too hard since with hard-working team members we can break these features into small sizes and progressively work up to final project.

## Project Title - TutorMe

## What and why? 

This website would allow students who have difficulty in a class to book someone who already took that class to help them out with the material in exchange for money.


## For Whom?

This application can target all college students, but we can start by just NYU students. 

## How? 
First, the website would feature a kind of marketplace where tutors would offer their services, as well as the classes they have taken. their grades and their subsquent ratings by their past students. For each tutor, they would have an availability calendar for the students to choose the convienient time. After setting up the call and finishing the transaction, they would meet via videocall or face-to-face depending on how they agreed on it before. The students can send material before hand in the chatbox


## Scope 

This project is doable as long as the team is not implementing from scratch the payment part and the video call tool. They could just integrate already done solutions (stripe, zoom, google meet...)
